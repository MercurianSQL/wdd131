            <p>49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know
                nothing at all,</p>
            <p>51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus
                should die for that nation;</p>
            <p>52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God
                that were scattered abroad.</p>

                palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
            <p>4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
